## Info about Fork:

This fork exists for two reasons:
1. make this framework usable for iVocabulary (Mac) where it's included in the main window (instead of in a NSPanel)
2. add Cocotron compatibility and a Cocotron target to compile it for Windows (and other Cocotron supported targets)

2. Double-click the InspectorKitPlugin.ibplugin file
